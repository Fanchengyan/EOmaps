The following sections provide information how to install **EOmaps**.

- A quick tutorial on how to **get started from scratch** is available here: :ref:`quickstart_guide`
- More details on how to **configure your favorite IDE** to get the most out of **EOmaps** can be found in the :ref:`faq` section :ref:`configuring_the_editor`.
- If you want to know how to setup **EOmaps** for development, have a look at the :ref:`contribute`

Installation with ``conda`` or ``mamba``
----------------------------------------

EOmaps is available on `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/eomaps>`_ and can be installed via:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge eomaps

This will install all required dependencies as well as the optional dependencies ``pandas``, ``geopandas``, ``mapclassify``, ``datashader``, ``owslib``, ``requests`` and ``qtpy``

   Since the dependencies of EOmaps can be demanding to solve for ``conda``, it is **highly recommended**
   that you use `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_ to install EOmaps in a conda-environment!

   `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_ is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++, capable of solving environments a lot faster.

   The recommended way to get started is to use `miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_, a minimalistic installer
   that provides both ``conda`` and ``mamba``, pre-configured to use the ``conda-forge`` channel by default.
   For other options, checkout the `mamba-docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html>`_

   Once ``mamba`` is installed, you just need to replace the term ``conda`` with ``mamba`` and you're good to go!

   .. code-block:: bash

      mamba install -c conda-forge eomaps

Installation with ``pip``
-------------------------

EOmaps is also available on `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/eomaps/>`_.

To install EOmaps with a **minimal set of dependencies**, use:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install eomaps

Optional dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some features (:ref:`webmap_layers`, :ref:`companion_widget`, etc.) require additional dependencies.
To use them you have to install the required dependency-groups:

To get **all features of EOmaps**, you can use one of:

- ``pip install eomaps[all]`` Install **ALL** required and optional dependencies
- ``pip install eomaps[all_nogui]`` Same as ``all`` but without installing the ``Qt`` GUI framework

In addition, you can use the following dependency-groups to activate only selected features:

- ``pip install eomaps[wms]`` Add dependencies required to use :ref:`WebMap services <webmap_layers>`
- ``pip install eomaps[gui]`` Add dependencies for ``Qt`` GUI framework (and the :ref:`CompanionWidget <companion_widget>`)
- ``pip install eomaps[io]`` Add support for ``pandas``, ``xarray``, ``geopandas`` and ``rioxarray``
- ``pip install eomaps[shade]`` Add capabilities to visualize extremely large datasets (via ``datashader``)
- ``pip install eomaps[classify]`` Add support for ``mapclassify`` to classify datasets

It is also possible to combine dependency-groups, e.g.: ``pip install eomaps[wms, gui]``.

A full list of all associated packages can be found in :ref:`setup_a_dev_env` or in the ``pyproject.toml`` file.
