Getting Started
---------------

To get started, have a look at the :doc:`installation` instructions and the  :doc:`user_guide/how_to_use/api_basics` section to learn how to use EOmaps!

In addition, there is also the :doc:`user_guide/interactivity/api_companion_widget` GUI that can be used to interactively edit/compare/overlay maps and explore the features and functionalities.


Data Visualization
------------------

Want to visualize some data? Have a look at the :doc:`user_guide/how_to_use/api_data_visualization` section to learn how to create beautiful maps with your datasets!

EOmaps provides a variety of plot-shapes so you can select a shape that suits the structure, size and spatial representativeness of your data:
